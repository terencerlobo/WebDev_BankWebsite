# Hackathon - Introduction to Web Development

I participated in a Hackathon where I had to create a banking interface for customers.

I embarked on a foundational journey into web development, creating an engaging banking interface with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This comprehensive interface includes a user-friendly login page and provides customers with a seamless experience to check account statuses, balances, and manage cards. Implemented MotionUI concepts to enhance the website's dynamic visual appeal while also incorporating a streamlined ticket-raising interface for issue resolution.
